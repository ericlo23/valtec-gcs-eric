# Valtec GCS

A simplified Ground Control Station for monitoring a simulated drone fleet.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, Redux Toolkit, Vite
- **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, WebSockets
- **Infra:** Docker Compose

## Quick start

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Frontend: http://localhost:5173  
Backend API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Running backend tests

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Architecture

The backend runs a drone simulator that generates telemetry for 3 virtual drones at 2 Hz. Each drone periodically goes offline for a short window — this is simulated automatically and is expected behaviour. A WebSocket endpoint streams this data to connected frontend clients. The frontend maintains a Redux store of drone states and renders a real-time dashboard.

```
Drone Simulator → WebSocket stream → Redux store → Dashboard UI

Frontend → REST POST /command → Command Service → Drone Simulator
```

## Known simplifications

This codebase is intentionally simplified for a single-process, in-memory environment. Not everything here reflects production best practices — that's on purpose.
